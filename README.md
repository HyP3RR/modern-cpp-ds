# modern-cpp-ds
As a C++ Enthusiast, this is the repo where I will post implementation of 
algos or things/data structures I find interesting, preferably using modern-c++ (CPP-17, etc). 


upcoming ideas:
1. claim -> stack region for each multithread is created via mmap, unmap
to simulate the arena environment and prevent Virtual address collision, 
test this via strace and a program.
